    "The following class `MANNCell` is the core of the memory-augmented neural network (MANN). You will implement the main parts of it in Tensorflow 2.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before any technical discussion of how the MANNCell should operate, let us look at what it should do on a general level. Suppose we have an input batch of 16 episodes of image samples, with each episode being of equal length of 50. Based on the design of the rest of the project (which we have already implemented for you), MANNCell should be called 50 times, each time having 16 input samples (along with the offseted labels), and outputting 16 output labels. More specifically, the MANNCell should produce classification labels $[\\hat{y}_0^t, ..., \\hat{y}_{15}^t]$ for all 16 iteration-$t$ image samples batch $[x^t_0+\\text{null}, x^t_1+y_0^t, ..., x^t_{15}+y_{14}^t]$ (\"+\" means concatenation) every time it is called; for your information, it is the class NTMOneShotLearningModel (already implemented below) that actually calls MANNCell 50 times. Your job is to make sure that at a single iteration $t$ (where $t=0,1,2,...,49$), MANNCell correctly parses the input arguments, produce the correct read and write weights $w^r_t, w^w_t$, correctly retrieve from and write to the memory to form $M_t$, and use the right material to get the logits for classification (they will be used for computing the labels and cross-entropy values in NTMOneShotLearningModel), and return the right states that will be used in the next iteration $t+1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us look at the input arguments of the method `call(self, inputs, states)`  of this class first:\n",
    "*   The `inputs` variable shall have the following shape: \n",
    "    `(batch_size, image_size+num_classes)`. \n",
    "  *   It corresponds to the $[x^t_0+\\text{null}, x^t_1+y^t_0, ..., x^t_{15}+y^t_{14}]$ above, for some iteration $t=0,1,...,49$.\n",
    "  *   `inputs[p,:]` is the $p$-th image in the batch `inputs` (note that the images are flattened to 1D tensors, and the labels are one-hot encoded).\n",
    "*   The `states` variable is a dictionary that has the following set of keys:`{'controller_state', 'read_vector_list', 'w_r_list', 'w_u', 'M'}`\n",
    "  *   `controller_state` is the state of the controller in iteration $t-1$; if $t-1 < 0$, then it is just zero-filled. As it is an LSTM cell, `controller_state` is of the form `[(batch_size, rnn_size),(batch_size, rnn_size)]` (technically speaking its shape is `(2, batch_size, rnn_size)`). The two `(batch_size, rnn_size)`-shaped entries in it correspond to the cell state and the hidden state of the LSTM. We will mostly be treating the LSTM controller as a black-box in this project, so we do not need to pay much attention to the details of its states. If interested, you can read about the LSTM cell's technical details in [tf.keras.layers.LSTMCell](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/LSTMCell).\n",

It is of the shape `(head_num, batch_size, memory_vector_dim)`. Basically, `read_vector_list[i,p,:]` is the $(t-1)$-th-iteration read vector of the $i$-th read head for the $p$-th input sample in the batch.\n",

We need a mapping that maps the controller_output to the read keys, write keys and the interpolation coefficient $\\alpha_t$'s, which will then be used for interacting with the memory. Three `tf.keras.layers.Dense` layers (one for producing read keys, one for write keys, one for the $\\alpha_t$'s) are sufficient, though you are welcome to try out more complicated structures. \n",
    "  *  **Remark 1**: each access to memory involves `head_num` number of heads, if you wish, you could just initialize `self.controller_output_to_read_keys` with `units=self.memory_vector_dim*self.head_num` and apply `tf.split` to the output of the dense layer along `axis=1` and `num_or_size_splits=head_num` in the `call` method (similar for the other two dense layers).\n",
